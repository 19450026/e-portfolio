							<p>First of all, i use VMware workstation to create the virtual box with Kali Linux, so we can easily make our test in a safe isolated space. Also, kali Linux comes with necessary tools like penetration test tool which is our topic right now </p><br>
								 
							<p> <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/kali.png"  width="400" 	height="500"  /></p></p>

							<p>After that, I open the pen box 1,8 application. When I was doing there were some importing errors that I had to solve them
								first. I tried to enter the main page which you can see the picture under this blog but couldn't reach there </p>
								<p> <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/part2.PNG"  width="400" 	height="500"  /></p></p>
								
							<p> the reason was even though the pen box comes with kali linux the real application part which we use for an attack is not uploaded. I solved this issue with find the necessary files at GitHub , download them to kali linux virtual box into pen box , after that, we opened the exactly same page under this blog.</p><br>

							<p>After that, we tried to scan the weakness of one random site to try our penetrating test. after some, I couldnt find any weakness in that site and Ä± finished my penetration test. </p><br>
							<p>evaluation: that was enjoyable to try to find weaknesses in random sites, even though we couldn't find any weaknesses, one of our objectives was to define any weakness and give a notification to the owner of that site, it was successful and helpful Assignment and I would do that again in the future. </p>	<br>
