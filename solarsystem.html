<p>The tools that i prefer to use:<br>
	Reconnaissance: Shodan is a search engine that scans and indexes various devices connected to the internet. It can help identify exposed systems and their vulnerabilities.<br>
	<br>
	Weaponization:Social Engineering Toolkit (SET): SET is a framework that assists in generating and deploying social engineering attacks, such as phishing emails, to trick users into executing malicious actions.i think social engineering is more dangerous than other because of you dont need to use hughe amount of information to start attack<br>
	<br>
	Phishing frameworks (Gophish, King Phisher): Phishing frameworks simplify the creation and 
	
	agement of phishing campaigns. They enable the simulation of real-world phishing attacks to educate users and test the effectiveness of security measures.as İ said at previsously i think social engineering is more dangerous.<br>
	<br>
	Exploitation:Metasploit: Metasploit contains an extensive collection of pre-built exploits, making it a popular choice for exploiting vulnerabilities in target systems. It provides a reliable and well-documented framework for penetration testing.i prefer this because i have some experiences with Metasploit.<br>
	<br>
	For others i dont have any preference and i just get nowledge about them newly, so i dont want to talk about them.<br>
