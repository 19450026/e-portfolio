							<p>IN the class 1 we learned first theoritical part about Cyber security: What is it and why is it important?
								Cybersecurity attacks can take various forms, targeting different aspects of computer systems, networks, and user data. Here are some common types of attacks:<br>
								<br>
								Malware: Malicious software, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, or trojans, that infects systems to cause harm, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.<br>
								<br>

								Phishing: A social engineering attack where attackers trick individuals into providing sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or login credentials by posing as trustworthy entities via emails, websites, or messages.<br>
								<br>
								Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS): DoS attacks overload a target system or network with excessive traffic or requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks use multiple compromised devices to launch the attack.<br>
								<br>
								Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): Attackers intercept and alter communication between two parties without their knowledge. This enables them to eavesdrop, manipulate data, or impersonate one of the parties.<br>
								<br>
								SQL Injection: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that use a database by injecting malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or manipulation of the database.<br>
								<br>
								Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, which are then executed by unsuspecting users' browsers. This allows the attacker to steal information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deliver malware.<br>
								<br>
								Zero-day Exploits: Attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities unknown to the software vendor. Attackers gain an advantage by targeting vulnerabilities before patches or security measures are available.<br>
								<br>
								Password Attacks: Techniques like brute-forcing, dictionary attacks, or password cracking tools are used to guess or crack passwords. Once successful, attackers gain unauthorized access to systems or user accounts.<br>
								<br>
								Social Engineering: Manipulating human psychology to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It can involve impersonation, pretexting, baiting, or other techniques.<br>
								<br>
								Malicious Insider Attacks: When an authorized individual with access to systems or sensitive data intentionally misuses or compromises them for personal gain or sabotage<br>
